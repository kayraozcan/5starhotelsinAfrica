# 5starhotelsinAfrica
The purpose of this study is defining the 5 star hotels in Africa continent. Data has taken from Google Places API and depicted with GeoJSON.

The working order of codes should be location.py -> excelling.py -> mapping.py

If you just want to reproduce map you can extract the data from "/DATA"

Important points to reproduce this project:
You should embed your own Google API Key in "Codes/location.py" command line = 10.

For reproduce data sets "5starhotelsinAfrica/Codes/location.py" should be ran for each country by chaning the command line = 13 with desired country 

Note that some of the countries might have more than 60 hotels but Google API only provides 60 results.
